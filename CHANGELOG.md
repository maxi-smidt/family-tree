## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-22

First stable release of Family Tree — a self-hostable web app for building and
exploring family history through an interactive visual tree.

### Added

- **Tree canvas** — interactive React Flow graph with drag-and-drop, automatic
  dagre layout, sub-tree extraction, and culling of off-screen nodes for large trees.
- **Members** — rich Markdown biographies, academic/honorific titles, deceased
  flag with partial/structured genealogy dates, hereditary disease records, and a
  tabbed edit form with inline photo upload and auto-linking.
- **Media** — gallery with bulk upload queue, per-tree configurable storage mode
  (compressed / original / both), and per-user storage quotas.
- **Genealogy content** — events, stories, and sources with citation & evidence
  records for member facts.
- **Views** — timeline map (Nominatim geocoding with location-type filters),
  composable read-only virtual views, and a List view with columns, filters,
  pagination, and CSV export.
- **Statistics** — customizable dashboard widgets.
- **Real-time collaboration (SSE)** — live propagation of layout changes, concurrent
  content edits, activity feed, ownership/access changes, friend requests and share
  invitations, storage-quota warnings, admin events, and long-running job progress.
- **Sharing & access** — owned + shared (`viewer` / `editor`) model with
  object-level permissions, a friend system, expiring invitation links, timed
  ownership-transfer with undo, and optional public read-only trees.
- **Accounts** — local JWT accounts plus optional Authentik (OIDC) SSO, TOTP
  two-factor authentication, per-user settings, and token-based self-registration.
- **Administration** — dedicated admin view, user management with soft-delete and
  scheduled purge, instance settings, and feature flags (global kill switch +
  per-user beta rollout).
- **Backup & portability** — scheduled backups with a restore UI, GEDCOM and
  high-resolution PNG export, and encrypted per-tree `.treedb` export/import bundles
  tagged with the app version.
- **Onboarding** — guided tour for new users.
- **Accessibility & UX** — keyboard navigation and screen-reader support for the
  canvas and views, localized ARIA labels, empty states, locale-aware date handling,
  and a dark/light theme built on OKLCH design tokens.
- **Internationalization** — English and German locales.
- **Mobile** — read-oriented browsing plus a management mode for import, export,
  sharing, and admin.
- **Quality** — Playwright end-to-end suite and CI wiring.

### Changed

- Migrated database columns from `camelCase` to `snake_case`; the JSON API
  contract is preserved via Pydantic alias generation.
- Squashed the Alembic migration history into a single `v1.0.0` baseline.
- Architecture cleanup: instance-wide relation-type registry, single repo-root
  `.env`, support for an external PostgreSQL, file-based logging, and a tag-based
  release flow.

### Fixed

- Pre-squash databases are auto-stamped onto the baseline on startup, so existing
  deployments upgrade cleanly across the squash.
- Locale-aware date formatting and inputs throughout the app.
- Numerous accessibility and UX polish fixes (ARIA labels, dark-mode tokens,
  error toasts, unsaved-changes guards).

### Security

- TOTP two-factor authentication for local accounts.
- Proactive session invalidation on account-state changes.
- Object-level permission enforcement on shared trees.
- Encrypted tree export bundles.
